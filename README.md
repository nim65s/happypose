Toolbox and trackers for object pose-estimation. Based on the work [CosyPose](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/cosypose) and [MegaPose](https://github.com/megapose6d/megapose6d). This directory is currently under development. Please refer to the [documentation](https://agimus-project.github.io/happypose/) for more details.


## Installation

To install happypose, you can use pip or uv.

We strongly suggest to install it in either a
[venv](https://docs.python.org/fr/3/library/venv.html) or a
[conda environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).

### Example with conda

```
git clone --branch dev --recurse-submodules https://github.com/agimus-project/happypose.git
cd happypose
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate happypose
pip install -r requirements/base.txt
```

With conda, you **must not** install `pypi`, `cpu` or `cu124` extras or requiremnts files.

### Example with uv

```
git clone --branch dev --recurse-submodules https://github.com/agimus-project/happypose.git
cd happypose
uv sync --extra pypi --extra cpu  # you *must* choose between cpu / cu124
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Example with venv

```
git clone --branch dev --recurse-submodules https://github.com/agimus-project/happypose.git
cd happypose
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements/pypi.txt -r requirements/cpu.txt  # you *must* choose between cpu / cu124
```

### Install extras:

- `pypi`: install pinocchio & opencv from PyPI (don't use this with conda)
- `cpu`: install torch for CPU from wheel (don't use this with conda)
- `cu124`: install torch for CUDA 12.4 from wheel (don't use this with conda)

## Create data directory

```
Create data dir /somewhere/convenient. The dataset to store are quite large.
export HAPPYPOSE_DATA_DIR=/somewhere/convenient
```

## Test the install

### CPU

If you work on CPU, these models need to be download :

```
#hope dataset models for CosyPose
python -m happypose.toolbox.utils.download --cosypose_models \
            detector-bop-hope-pbr--15246 \
            coarse-bop-hope-pbr--225203 \
            refiner-bop-hope-pbr--955392
```

```
# For MegaPose
python -m happypose.toolbox.utils.download --megapose_models
```

and the examples

```
python -m happypose.toolbox.utils.download --examples barbecue-sauce
```

In the HappyPose folder:

```
pytest -v ./tests
```

You may need to install `pytest-order` : `pip installp pytest-order`. In this case, test related to the `evaluation` and the `training` of CosyPose are not run. If you want to use these functionalities, you need a GPU.

### GPU

Tests related to `evaluation` and `training` will be run if a GPU is available. Hence, a few more downloads are needed :

```
#ycbv models
python -m happypose.toolbox.utils.download --cosypose_models \
            coarse-bop-ycbv-pbr--724183 \
            refiner-bop-ycbv-pbr--604090
```

```
python -m happypose.toolbox.utils.download --bop_dataset ycbv
```

```
python -m happypose.toolbox.utils.download --test-results
```

The tests take much longer in this case.
